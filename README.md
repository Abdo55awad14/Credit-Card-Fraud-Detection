## Background

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and customers. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data that may indicate fraudulent activities. The aim is to create an accurate and reliable fraud detection system.

## Installation

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, run the main script to train the model and test it on the provided dataset. You can use your dataset by modifying the input data path in the script. Run the script using the following command:

Review the code and modify any parameters or settings as needed for your use case.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [source of the dataset]. It contains information about credit card transactions, including transaction amount, time, and other relevant attributes.

## Modeling

The project utilizes [describe the modeling approach, algorithms, and techniques used]. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess its performance.

## Results

The results of the credit card fraud detection model are presented in [describe the results and performance metrics obtained]. The model's effectiveness in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions is evaluated and discussed.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch`
3. Make changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-branch`
5. Submit a pull request.
